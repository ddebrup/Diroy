 ***Our Approach***
 On brainstorming towards developing solutions for the smart tracking of people/vehicles, for tracking any kind of deviation, finding time-taken in traveling, tracking for overspeeding, we first looked at the points of application, where our idea could be applied and what problems are faced in those situations, so that we can train our application so as to cater tracking solutions along with addressing these issues. 

On researching over the problem statement, we find that apart from applying the project in the green corridors of Kaziranga National Park, we can also implement our idea in the cases when floods are creating devastating effects, where it is uncertain about where and when the vehicles carrying the relief materials or rescue people are approaching and, to also track people who are stuck in their homes or unsafe places in those floods or even any kind of calamity. Furthermore, we believe we can even apply our project in *creating a rapid notification based service for any kind of emergency situation such as women safety*, where our solution not only helps in becoming a *tracking tool* but also a *quick communication channel*.
