### Problem Statement: 
*Smart movement tracking solution of people/vehicles from point A to point B*

<br />
<br />

#### Team: 
*Deluminators*
<br />
#### Institute: 
*International Institution of Information Technology, Bhubaneswar*
 <br /> <br /> <br />
 
 ### Our Approach
 <br />
 
 On brainstorming towards developing solutions for the smart tracking of people/vehicles, for tracking any kind of deviation, finding time-taken in traveling, tracking for overspeeding, we first looked at the points of application, where our idea could be applied and what problems are faced in those situations, so that we can train our application so as to cater tracking solutions along with addressing these issues. 

On researching over the problem statement, we find that apart from applying the project in the green corridors of Kaziranga National Park, we can also implement our idea in the cases when floods are creating devastating effects, where it is uncertain about where and when the vehicles carrying the relief materials or rescue people are approaching and, to also track people who are stuck in their homes or unsafe places in those floods or even any kind of calamity. Furthermore, we believe we can even apply our project in *creating a rapid notification based service for any kind of emergency situation such as women safety*, where our solution not only helps in becoming a *tracking tool* but also a *quick communication channel*.

 ### Our Solution
<br />

On digging more into the problem statement, some points came into the highlights, first one being, the current tracking services are facing are firstly lack of proper and stable internet connection and secondly, lack of a proper communication channel so as to transmit and receive information and finally, unstable GPS and GPRS data sources from which location information can be fetched. 


In devising the solution for the above-said problems we considered applying the conceptual framework of Swarm Intelligence into our product thus making a solution which can track and communicate without the usage of GPS/GPRS/Internet technologies thus making a sustainable solution for varied usage and applications, so as to simplify the whole tracking process.
